Rocket Slingers is a physics based video game where object momentum and rope dynamics are used to navigate environments and solve puzzles.  The player is strapped to a controllable rocket and has
a rope that can be deployed to attach to objects in the evironment.

My idea is to combine the free-flowing whooshieness of Spider-Man games with the speed and intertia of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games.  Both have a tremendously gratifying *feel* to play,
which I find to be the most satisfying aspect of games.

Rocket Slingers uses the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library for input and sound, [Box 2D](http://box2d.org/) as the physics
engine, and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) for graphics rendering.

The game is in very early development and gets "as available" programming time, which is not as much as I would like because it's super fun ;)
